This repository contains the work and solutions for the Customer Analysis and Modeling Assignment. The project includes data analysis, customer segmentation, and model-building tasks using customer transaction data.

Overview

The assignment consists of three main tasks:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the provided data to derive business insights.
Lookalike Model: Build a recommendation system to suggest similar customers based on profile and transaction history.
Customer Segmentation: Perform customer segmentation using clustering algorithms based on transaction and demographic data.
