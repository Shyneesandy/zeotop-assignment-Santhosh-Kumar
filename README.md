This repository contains the work and solutions for the Customer Analysis and Modeling Assignment. The project includes data analysis, customer segmentation, and model-building tasks using customer transaction data.

Overview

The assignment consists of three main tasks:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the provided data to derive business insights.
Lookalike Model: Build a recommendation system to suggest similar customers based on profile and transaction history.
Customer Segmentation: Perform customer segmentation using clustering algorithms based on transaction and demographic data.

CONCLUSION
 In this project, we explored and analyzed a dataset containing customer information, product transactions, and other relevant details to extract valuable business insights. By applying Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we gained a deeper understanding of customer behavior, regional trends, and product sales patterns. We then built a Lookalike Model to recommend similar customers based on their profiles and purchase history, which can help businesses target their marketing efforts more effectively
